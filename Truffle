Notes:

The go-ethereum client is commonly referred to as geth, which is the the command line interface for running a full ethereum node implemented in Go. By installing and running geth, you can take part in the ethereum frontier live network and:
	•	mine real ether
	•	transfer funds between addresses
	•	create contracts and send transactions
	•	explore block history
	•	and much much more
	•	

Alethzero - ethconsole  - geth (create a full node)

Truffle(contracts) - geth(eth client) - uses ether pudding


Alethzero: wallet
geth (node creation):  mine
Mix :
Mist (IDE): flavour of ethereum
Truffle : geth iDE
