  Installing MIST using:
  https://github.com/ethereum/mist
 
  Mist required NPM and meteor the following dependencies:
    - Electron
    - Node v6.0
    - Yarn package manager
 
  Downloading a stable release of the Mist browser:

  Ideally, just pasting the link to a blockchain application URL on the mist browser should work. That same URL will not reflect on the normal browsers as it requires decentralised servers and blockchain technology to support its backend.
