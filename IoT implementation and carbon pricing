-> OPTIONS AVAILABLE :-
* Arduino  * BeagleBone black * Wandboard *Odroid *RasberryPi
****************---- Awesome, then we ll start working with BBB, worst case it doesn't match, we can switch to my pi. 

http://www.udoo.org/udoo-vs-beaglebone-black-vs-wandboard-vs-odroid-x2-vs-raspberry-pi/

- Ethereum platform documentation seems to support the following - Raspberry Pi, Odroid, BeagleBone Black, Wandboard
Which one to choose?
    Raspberry Pi        - Rs. 4499
    Odroid XU3/XU4      - Rs. 7900
    BeagleBone Black    - Rs. 4200
    Wandboard           - Rs. 9730
    
*****************------- I choose BBB
EthEmbedded has binaries for several of these platforms: 
- Current "Home stead" ready images: http://ethembedded.com/?page_id=102 
- BeagleBoneBlack (BBB) https://github.com/EthEmbedded/BBB-Eth-Install

2. SENSORS TO USE
> To measure carbon(CO2, CO, CH4) :
    i.  MQ series
    ii. NDIR sensor
   
    
From https://www.element14.com/community/community/design-challenges/in-the-air-design-challenge/blog/2014/11/10/carbon-footprint-monitoring--architecture
- CC3200 as the main processor for both the indoor and outdoor sensor nodes.
- MSP430 as the main processor for the Vehicle Emission sensor
- Beagle Bone Black (AM335x) for the central hub
- ACS712 for current sensor
- MQ-135 + MQ-7 air quality sensor
- HTU-21D digital temperature and humidity sensor

****************----- Awesome, we ll need to use only 2/3 one each for the GHG, HTU21D is a humidity sensor we wont use all that right?
If you can select the 2 or 3 best sensors required for the project and reference optional ones like TMP36 is optional for HTU21D for 
temperature... then you can include that in the documentation...
